Perfect 👍 — I’ll create a clean **README.md** for your law firm website project.
This will explain the project purpose, structure, setup, and how to contribute.

Here’s a good starting version:

```markdown
# Double M Advocates Website

A professional and visually appealing website for **Double M Advocates**, designed to present the firm’s services, team, and contact details in a modern and organized way.

## 🌐 Live Sections

- **About** – Background and values of the firm  
- **Practice Areas** – Legal services offered  
- **Our Team** – Profiles of firm partners, associates, and staff  
- **Contact** – Contact form, location map, and details
